# Project-1
This is the website for the Improv client and our first class project.

The Client runs Improv classes out his studio in Hollywood, and he needed an online presense to
communicate his location and his weekly schedule.  He also needed to have an way for potential
students to find his school and sign up online for his workshops.

We created a website that expresses the fun personality of his school while also informing any
users about what the school has to offer and how to get in touch with the Client. 

We incorporated CSS animation, a google-document submit form, and modal popups, all on a clean, easy-to-use, 
multi-page website.  

We primarily used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a map API.
